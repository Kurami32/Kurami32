Hi! I'm a 19yo student of IT Engineering. (yeah)

English is not my first language -- I think that is fine, but sometimes I mix things up lol.

I'm not too good at math...  I suck at it (seriously), but I try my best :')

When I'm free I like to play music (Teto!), and also play games or view some anime.

I'm trying to learn some webdev and have planned to learn some Go too, and maybe Android, idk, we'll see.

(I'm learning a lot from Filebrowser Quantum!)
